# Tinder
Code to auto swipe right so I don't have to

I got most of the code from here: https://github.com/fbessez/Tinder for authenticating and for all the api calls. I wanted to play around with the tinder api and this was very easy and fun to do. 

In the future I might be interested in creating a more complete bot using machine learning and natural language processing.
